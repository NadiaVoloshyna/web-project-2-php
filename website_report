## request
Write a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and put it onto the remote webserver.
The goal is to practice the basic website development. View the site on the phone to check the responsiveness.

The website is a profile of yourself. It should include sections about: 
• Your name as a header 
• A statement about your aspirations within Abertay 
• A statement about your favourite hobby 
• Your programme at Abertay
• Abertay address and contact details 

## analysis
The inputs to the project are the following:
- Created web content
- Optimized images
- Provided server space on the Abertay student web server to host a website
- Registered profile on the LinkedIn social network

The website takes the user to the Home page with information about the website owner. There is a navigation menu with 
internal links and a footer with an external link to the social network profile. The user can navigate from the Home page to the 
Connect page that contains the registration form. Another internal link goes to the Friends page with all saved 
to the database connections listed. There is a deletion option to remove the connection from the persistent storage.

The web site is hosted on the Abertay Mayar server - http://mayar.abertay.ac.uk/~2208417/website. The user interface 
is supposed to be minimalist with three-four basic colors.
