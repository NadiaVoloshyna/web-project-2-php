##### P3 #####
Develop a Cyber Security News webpage. It should include three articles: Malware(100 words), Ransomware(100 words), 
approaches to Password Cracking(200 words). The article content can be used from any source (provide a URL as a reference in the article). 
Readers should be able to comment on the news article. Readers can also read comments from other users. 

The web application should be dynamic with the following technical requirements: 
• Clear use of HTML5 tags including text, images, and links. 
• Use of a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap, to provide a responsive layout 
• Use of a custom CSS to demonstrate any element 
• Use of CSS transition or CSS Animation or Canvas Animation 
• Use of PHP server-side script(s) to enable: 
  - reading a table in a database – view old comments 
  - writing to a table in a database – post new comments

The web application should have a professional look with the following characteristics: 
• Attractive layout, colour, and use of images 
• Good contrast between the background and text 
• Clear functionality from the user’s perspective 
• Purposeful interactive elements which enhance the appearance and functionality of the application

The web application should not have large areas of empty space or oversized graphics. 
The web application should not have pointless use of interactivity e.g., mouseover logo to show 
a larger logo. Pointless or trivial features will not receive full credit.

## request

The goal is to practice more advanced HTML (with attention to semantics) and CSS techniques (control the appearance of the content). 
Apply CSS image gallery to work with images. 
Practice PHP server-side scripts to enable:

- Optimized images
- Provided server space on the Abertay student web server to host a website
- Registered profile on the LinkedIn social network

The website takes the user to the Home page with an image gallery where images and their descriptions are used as links to three technical articles. Each link goes to the separate page with an article content, a form with a built-in validation for adding comments, and a list of previous comments. The user can provide their name and leave a comment to the chosen article. Comments are stored in a database. There is a navigation menu with an internal link to the home page and a footer with an external link to the social network profile.

The web site is hosted on the Abertay Mayar server - http://mayar.abertay.ac.uk/~2208417/tech_news. 
The user interface is supposed to be minimalist with three-four basic colours. The focus was made on the organization of the information.

## design
The web application architecture:
Client: HTML, CSS

There are four pages on the website. The sitemap is: 
Home page                       First page                 Second page                Third page
 
Website Title                   Article1                   Article2                   Article3 
Statement about the news site   Form for the comment       Form for the comment       Form for the comment
Image galary with links         Previous comments list     Previous comments list     Previous comments list

The Home page contains information about the website and links to the articles. The links are organized with <div> blocks. Each block contains an image and a description.
The image acts as a link. To make the whole <div> block clickable the following technique is used: inside the link an empty <span> tag is set, the block is given position:relative, 
the span is given position:absolute, width:100% and height:100%. 
Each article page displays the content, collects data from user, validates, and sends it to the server to store in the database. The previous comments are retrieved from the database and listed below the form.

Server: Apache HTTP server, PHP, MySQL
Responds to the requests and sends an HTML document to the browser. Processes the user's data and stores it in the database.
