##### P3 #####
Develop a Cyber Security News webpage. It should include three articles: Malware(100 words), Ransomware(100 words), 
approaches to Password Cracking(200 words). The article content can be used from any source (provide a URL as a reference in the article). 
Readers should be able to comment on the news article. Readers can also read comments from other users. 

The web application should be dynamic with the following technical requirements: 
• Clear use of HTML5 tags including text, images, and links. 
• Use of a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap, to provide a responsive layout 
• Use of a custom CSS to demonstrate any element 
• Use of CSS transition or CSS Animation or Canvas Animation 
• Use of PHP server-side script(s) to enable: 
  - reading a table in a database – view old comments 
  - writing to a table in a database – post new comments

The web application should have a professional look with the following characteristics: 
• Attractive layout, colour, and use of images 
• Good contrast between the background and text 
• Clear functionality from the user’s perspective 
• Purposeful interactive elements which enhance the appearance and functionality of the application

The web application should not have large areas of empty space or oversized graphics. 
The web application should not have pointless use of interactivity e.g., mouseover logo to show 
a larger logo. Pointless or trivial features will not receive full credit.

- Optimized images
- Provided server space on the Abertay student web server to host a website

The website takes the user to the Home page with image galary where images are used as links to the three technical articles. There are 
short descriptions to the images to provide the user with summary of the articles. Each image-link goes to the separate page with article content, 
form for adding comments and view all functionality to look through the previous comments. The deletion option allows to remove the comment from the list. 
There is a navigation menu with an internal link and a footer with an external link to the social network profile.

The web site is hosted on the Abertay Mayar server - http://mayar.abertay.ac.uk/~2208417/tech_news. 
<!-- The user interface is supposed to be minimalist with three-four basic colours. -->
